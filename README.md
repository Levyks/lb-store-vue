# lb-store-vue

Simple project that I used to test and learn about state management in Vue with Vuex

It currently consists of 2 pages, the "Catalog" and the "Cart", the items in the cart are synced between those pages, as well as in the cart icon in the navbar.

This cart is also stored in localStorage, so if you reload the page, the cart will be restored.

Layout idea and demo products from [here](https://auth0.com/blog/state-management-in-svelte-applications/)
